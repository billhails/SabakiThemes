# Yunzi Theme for Sabaki

A theme with biconvex [Yunzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunzi) stones for [Sabaki](http://sabaki.yichuanshen.de/).
Rendered in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

I've used a single consistent HDRI lighting setup for all the components so they should fit together well.
I could include the `.blend` files if anyone asks but for most
people they're unneccessary.

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/billhails/SabakiThemes/releases) the theme file and install it directly inside Sabaki
under 'Preferences' > 'Themes' > 'Install Theme...'.

## Build

To create a Sabaki theme archive, install dependencies using npm, then run the build script:

This will create `yunzi.sabakitheme.asar`.
